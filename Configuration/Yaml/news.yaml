# This is an example how to extend news records, use it via imports:
# imports:
#   - { resource: "EXT:cs_seo/Configuration/Yaml/news.yaml" }
records:

  # new index and table name of the model
  tx_news_domain_model_news:

    # getText. Returns news uid. If set, news meta tags are shown.
    enable: 'GP:tx_news_pi1|news'


    # if the model already has fields like title etc. define them as fallback
    fallback:

      # cs_seo title field fallback = news title field
      title: title

      # cs_seo description field fallback = news description field
      # also more fields possible within curly brackets, e.g. description: {teaser} - {author}
      description: teaser


    # enable evaluation for news
    evaluation:

      # additional params to initialize the detail view, the pipe will be replaced by the uid
      getParams: >-
        &tx_news_pi1[controller]=News&tx_news_pi1[action]=detail&tx_news_pi1[news]=|

      # detail pid for the current records, only if set the table will be available
      detailPid: 0
